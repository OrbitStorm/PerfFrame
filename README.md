# PerfFrame

PerfFrame is a lightweight addon that keeps your FPS and latency visible at all times. It provides a simple, movable display for performance stats, so you don’t need to hover over the default UI to check your frame rate or connection.

Inspired by Pytilix’s FPS-MS-Tracker, PerfFrame has been fully rewritten with persistent settings, accessibility options, quality-of-life updates, and an in-game configuration panel.

### Features
* Real-time FPS and latency tracking
* Optional clock and mail indicators
* Optional tooltip showing addon memory and network stats
* Adjustable text scale for better readability
* Movable frame with saved position between sessions
* Slash commands for quick adjustments (/perf)
* Interface Options panel for easy configuration
* Lightweight and unobtrusive design


### Accessibility

PerfFrame includes multiple text-scale options to improve visibility on any display. Whether you play on a laptop or a high-resolution monitor, your performance data remains clear and easy to read. Choose from three options: Normal (100%), Bigger (125%), and Biggest (150%).

### Installation
* Extract the PerfFrame folder into:
  World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/
* Enable PerfFrame in the AddOns menu.
* Type /perf help in-game for a list of available commands.
